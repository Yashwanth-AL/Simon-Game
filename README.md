# Simon-Game
Simon Game  : This is a simple Simon game built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The game tests the player's memory by generating a random sequence of colors and sounds, which the player must replicate in the correct order. As the game progresses, the sequence becomes longer and more challenging.
